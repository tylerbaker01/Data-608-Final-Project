The proposal requires 4 pieces of information.
1. What do I want to show?
I want to show how education levels of countries play a vital role for everyday life of a country. Specifically, I would like to see if there is any coorelation
to PISA scores and the wealth of a nation(GDP per capita), life expectancy, violence(intentional homicides), and innovation(amount of researches in Research and
Developement per million people).
2. Why is it relevant to a current policy, business, or justice issues?
Well, if I can show that education levels do play a role in those areas which I listed, then it is vitally important that we take education more serious. This would be 
evidence to support the increased funding of the Education Department.
On the other side, if there is no coorelation then maybe education isn't as important as we assume it to be.
3. What technologies do I plan to use?
I believe that a Shiny app with interactive plots will best help me explore and visualize my data.
4. What data do I plan to use? 
All of the data I intend to use will be open source.
The links I used are as follows:
For PISA data
https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/ where I then used the data explorer application they provide.
For GDP per capita
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?view=chart
For life expectancy
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?view=chart
For intentional homicides
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?view=chart
For amount of researchers in R&D
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.SCIE.RD.P6?view=chart
