The proposal requires 4 pieces of information.
1. What do I want to show?
I want to show how education levels of countries play a vital role for everyday life of a country. Specifically, I would like to see if there is any coorelation
to PISA scores and the wealth of a nation(GDP per capita), life expectancy, violence(intentional homicides), and innovation(amount of researches in Research and
Developement per million people).
2. Why is it relevant to a current policy, business, or justice issues?
Well, if I can show that education levels do play a role in those areas which I listed, then it is vitally important that we take education more serious. This would be 
evidence to support the increased funding of the Education Department.
3. What technologies do I plan to use?
I believe that a Shiny app with interactive plots will best help me explore and visualize my data.
4. What data do I plan to use?
