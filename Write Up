The reason that this data is important for a few reasons:
The first is that education is always a hot topic in the US, but especially now.
  I say this because some states are allowing high school graduates to become teachers. Teachers are underpaid and quitting their jobs. Finally, there seems to be a push to provide online education.
The other reason is because the world seems to be a dangerous place right now. If we could make the world a happier, safer place by taking education more serious then we absolutely should.
